# Teyvat_TP_Json

###

First of all, when you use this json collection, you should know the concept of this json collection:
### Our goal is 9999 supplies!


This json description:
A total of 3 json collections are used in rotation.
First day using teleports1.
The next day using teleports2.
The third day using teleports3.
The fourth day using teleports1....
cycle like this
More conveniently, you can decompress this json collection to the file directory of ak/ac/bk. When you need to use a certain tp package, you only need to change the name of the tp package to teleports.


The number of this json collection:
Each collection has a total of 1800+ points, and the average time is about 6 hours, which includes all the materials of the whole Teyvat (because the scarlet hydrangea cannot be collected automatically, it is not included).

After running this json collection completely, you can get:
1. A number of materials dropped by all monsters in Tivat Continent
2. Several plant ingredients + breakthrough material + crystal butterfly
3. 500+ animal meat
4. 500+ poultry meat
5. 300~400 crystal ore + amethyst block
6. 100+ holy relic dog food
7. 25w Mora
...wait wait wait

Note: decompress the cfg.json in the compressed package to the directory of ak/ac/bk, and choose to overwrite to realize the fool-like one-key configuration (the menu call-out key is F12)
